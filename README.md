# Piano
## Describe:
My second project made for Robotics course, in my second year is a Piano. It has five buttons, four of which can be programmed to make the sound of any note. The 5th button pressed togheter with any second one plays a diffrent song. It also has a red led which lights up at any button touch. It's a simple project yet a very good recap of what we learned during our optional laboratories at the University.
## Components:
- Arduino Uno R3 x 1
- USB Cable x 1
- Breadboard x 2
- Matrix 8 x 8 x 1
- Rezistor 220 ohmi x 6
